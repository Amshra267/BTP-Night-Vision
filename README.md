# Night-Vision

This repository contains our research and exploration on the Nightime Computer Vision techniques. We can see several applications of Night-Vision in the upcoming years mainly in surveillance, Autonomous driving in night time scenarios (with less brightness around the roads) and many more.

We will broadly categorized our Research and B-Tech Project into two segments:-

 - Exploring Object Detection Algorithms in Night Vision and add small modification using classical computer vision on input Image for increasing detection accuracy.
 -  Extending it to Face Detection and Recognition and also tried to increase it's accuracy by some classical methods.

Till Semester-VI we had completed part-1 to a good level
  - [PPT LINK](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12UK9EkO_1dVs8B5-fNCc7cl-8FWKsg2vIE2kiuW5Ghg/edit?usp=sharing) 
  - [REPORT](Report_VI_SEM.pdf)

In the VII semester we are focussing on Second Category of Face detection and Recognition of those person in night scenarios.
